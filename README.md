# vehicle-status-dashboard
I made a small Flask webapp to report the status of vehicles in the fleet I manage at work. They break a lot and people are frequently asking me if they're available. This is my first Flask app, first webapp, and I learned a lot about HTML, how frameworks work and how they build out HTML, and actually using a server to serve up an app.

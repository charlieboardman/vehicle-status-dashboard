# vehicle-status-dashboard
This is a little Flask app to report the status of vehicles at my work. I manage their maintenance and people ask me frequently what they can use and what's broken. I made this to easily update and communicate their status to everyone. This is my first webapp, and I learned about Flask, how frameworks generate HTML, and web servers.
